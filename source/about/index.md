I
am so unfamous that no one comes to me to talk about business.

I
thought this is so wasteful so I
keep on working...
keep on working...
keep on...

If you want to reach me, please contact <bejond.shao@gmail.com> (Please don't mail to this address). Attaching a gmail address just to pretend international. I rarely check that email. <bejond@163.com> is more offen, well, not so offen. Because the 163 email is full of junk ADs. How did they get my email? Why am I so famous? That doesn't make sense. 2017-08-23

I
make a niubility email for myself in the end: <a@bejond.org>. Welcome to disturb. 2017-09-12
