**Open Source:** **[Grape](https://github.com/bejondshao/grape)**

**Introduction:** Use python to obtain basic information of A-share stocks, daily trading information, calculate K-line and other technical indicators, and screen through certain stock selection strategies.

Screened stocks can be adjusted according to different strategies, and non-relational database MongoDB is used for local persistence, and the screening results are automatically uploaded to [personal blog](https://tech.bejond.org/2020/01/05/grape%E8%82%A1%E7%A5%A8%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8-2020/).
