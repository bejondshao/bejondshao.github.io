@ UMA(User-Managed Access)是OAuth 2.0的轮廓。UMA定义资源拥有者如何控制他的资源，允许其他客户端访问。即便资源分布在不同的服务器中，只需要一个授权中心允许访问即可。

User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0. UMA defines how resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients operated by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside on any number of resource servers, and where a centralized authorization server governs access based on resource owner policies.
